                <h3 style=text-align:center>Introduction to Lotus Root</h3>
<h4>Basic Information</h4>
<p>  Lotus root, also known as Nelumbo nucifera root, 
    is the rhizome of the perennial aquatic herb Nelumbo
     nucifera in the family Nelumbonaceae. 
     It mostly grows in water environments rich in humus such as 
     shallow lakes and low - lying swamps. 
     It is distributed in many countries including China, 
     Japan, and India. In China, Hubei, Jiangsu and other places are important production areas of lotus root.</p>
<h4>Morphological Characteristics</h4>
<p>Lotus root is an underground stem, thick and multi - jointed, growing horizontally in the bottom mud. It is divided into main roots, secondary roots and tertiary roots. The main root generally consists of 3 - 7 joints. The joints are constricted, and the internodes are cylindrical. The tip of the lotus root is thick and short, the posterior node is thin and long, and the middle part is the body of the lotus root. The skin color of lotus root is mostly white or yellow - white, with light brown spots scattered on it. Inside, there are fine filaments and pore channels. When the lotus root is broken, the filaments are still connected, forming the phenomenon of "the lotus root is broken but the filaments are still attached".
<h4>Variety Classification</h4>
<p>According to the starch content, lotus root can be divided into starchy lotus root and crispy lotus root. Starchy lotus root has a high starch content and a low amylose content, with a delicate and glutinous taste, which is suitable for steaming, boiling soup, such as Qianshan Xuehu Tribute Lotus Root. Crispy lotus root has a low starch content and a high amylose content, with a crisp texture, suitable for stir - frying and cold dressing, like Jinan White Lotus Root. According to the growth period, it can be divided into early - maturing lotus root, middle - maturing lotus root and late - maturing lotus root. According to the suitable planting water level, it can be divided into deep - water lotus root and shallow - water lotus root.
<h4>Nutritional Value and Efficacy</h4>
<p>Lotus root is rich in a variety of nutrients. Every 100 grams of fresh lotus root contains 1.2 grams of protein, 11.5 grams of carbohydrates, 0.2 grams of fat, 2.2 grams of dietary fiber, as well as trace elements such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins such as vitamin C and vitamin B6. From a medicinal point of view, raw lotus root is cold in nature and has the effect of clearing heat and cooling blood. It can be used to treat symptoms such as fever, thirst, nosebleeds, and hemoptysis. The mucin and dietary fiber in lotus root can combine with cholate salts in the human body, cholesterol and triglycerides in food, and excrete them from the feces, playing a role in relieving constipation, stopping diarrhea, strengthening the spleen and improving appetite.
<h4>Culinary Methods</h4>
<p>There are various ways to eat lotus root. It can be eaten raw. For example, after washing and slicing, it can be eaten directly, with a sweet and crispy taste. It can also be cooked, such as made into candied lotus root slices, lotus root stuffed with meat, sweet and sour lotus root slices, lotus root and spare rib soup and other delicious dishes. It can also be processed into lotus root starch, lotus root juice, candied fruits, canned food and other foods.

<h3 style=text-align:center>Introduction to Lotus Root Slices</h3>
<h4>Production Method</h4>
<p>Lotustus root slices are made by washing, peeling the lotus root and then cutting it into slices. According to different cooking needs, the thickness of lotus root slices can vary. Generally, lotus root slices for cold dressing or stir - frying are thinner, while those for boiling soup or baking can be a little thicker.
<h4>Taste Characteristics</h4>
<p>If the lotus root slices are cut from crispy lotus root, they have a crispy and refreshing taste. When cold - dressed or stir - fried, they can maintain their fresh and crispy texture, bringing a refreshing taste experience. If they are cut from starchy lotus root, after steaming or boiling in soup, the taste becomes soft, glutinous and sweet, melting in the mouth with a unique flavor.
<h4>Cooking Applications</h4>
<p>Lotus root slices are widely used in cooking. In Chinese cuisine, cold - dressed lotus root slices are a common appetizer. After blanching the lotus root slices, mix them with seasonings such as minced garlic, vinegar, light soy sauce and sesame oil, which is sour, spicy and delicious. Stir - fried lotus root slices can highlight the crispness of the lotus root slices. When paired with ingredients such as green peppers and wood ear, the colors are rich and the nutrition is balanced. In addition, lotus root slices can also be used to make lotus root boxes. Stuff minced meat between two slices of lotus root, coat it with batter and deep - fry it, which is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. In Western cuisine, lotus root slices can also be used as a side dish, paired with meat or seafood for baking or frying, adding a unique texture and flavor to the dishes.
<h4>Storage Method</h4>
<p>Freshly cut lotus root slices are prone to oxidation and blackening. Therefore, attention should be paid to preservation during storage. The lotus root slices can be soaked in clean water with a little white vinegar or lemon juice added to prevent oxidation. They can also be blanched, drained, put into a sealed bag and stored in the freezer of the refrigerator. This can extend the shelf life of the lotus root slices and make them convenient to use at any time.
